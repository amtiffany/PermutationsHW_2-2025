//
// * Code up a routine that generates n-arry string of a given length L. In other words, given an alphabet of chars (strings of length 1) generate a list (set) of all strings of a given length that can be constructed. Naturally it might be a good idea to use recursion. If your alphabet consists of 2 things you will be generating binary strings effectively.
//
// * For the above exercise you will want to write a power function to compute n^k. What is a good way to implement it? Say we have n^10. We could just write a loop to multiply n by itself 10 times, right? Is this efficient?
// How about if we wrote it as:
//
// d = n*n // n^2
// dd = d * d // n^4
// result = dd * dd * d // n^10
//
// The above requires 4 multiplications instead of 9. Seems faster, doesn’t it?
//
// Can you see a pattern? Can you write an efficient generic power function using this approach? Use the function to test the previous exercise.
//
// * Using F#’s Sets code up: permutations, combinations. This is an already pretty hard, but if you can do this improve your permutations algorithm using mutable structures as discussed in class. Basically given a set of chars of size N and length K generate all nPk possibilities. Do the same of nCk.
//
// * Now generate a PowerSet of a given set
//
// * Given that you know the formula for the number of elements in the output of each problem you can test at least the size of the generated output is correct. To do that please write some good routines for computing nPk (e.g. no need to compute the full factorials when you can compute the falling powers of the form 5*4*3 and stop; no need to divide). Basically think of an efficient implementation for these things.
//
// * All the code should be tested, especially the edge cases.
